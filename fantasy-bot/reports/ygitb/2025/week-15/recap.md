- Naveb’s Lamar Jackson and Chase Brown kept the scoreboard ticking just enough to topple StatutoryRaitests, despite Dallas Goedert and D’Andre Swift shining bright.

### K309h (5-9) 149.04 – 110.7 leejsv (5-9)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Amon-Ra St. Brown (DET WR – 41.4 pts), 🏃 Josh Jacobs (GB RB – 23.2 pts)
leejsv looked to cruise behind a staggering 41.4 points from Amon-Ra St. Brown and a strong 31.1 from James Cook, but K309h’s Brock Purdy and Josh Jacobs proved too tenacious. Purdy’s 26.2 points at QB and Jacobs’ 23.2 on the ground added up to a balanced assault that edged out leejsv’s firepower. Despite the star-studded performance from St. Brown, K309h’s depth and consistency sealed a surprising 149.04 to 110.7 upset, flipping the script in this tight showdown.

### StatutoryRaitests (4-10) 58.8 – 137.98 naveb (6-8)
**Star Performers:** 🧲 Dallas Goedert (PHI TE – 25.0 pts), 🧠 Lamar Jackson (BAL QB – 14.6 pts)
Despite Dallas Goedert lighting it up with 25 points and D’Andre Swift adding 22.6, StatutoryRaitests just couldn’t keep pace with naveb’s efficient attack. Lamar Jackson’s 14.6 points and Chase Brown’s 16.0 may not scream explosive, but their steady grind was enough to dismantle StatutoryRaitests’ hopes. Naveb’s 137.98 points was a statement win over a team with more star power on paper, showing that balanced scoring can trump big individual hauls.

### Franc19 (8-6) 137.3 – 96.06 jacross2000 (7-7)
**Star Performers:** 🧲 Trey McBride (ARI TE – 37.4 pts), 🎯 Puka Nacua (LAR WR – 27.9 pts)
Franc19’s Trey McBride had a monster day with 37.4 points, and Jalen Hurts contributed a solid 22.9 to push the offense. But jacross2000’s Puka Nacua and Zay Flowers kept the pressure on with steady WR production. Despite scoring 96.06 points, jacross2000 couldn’t quite match Franc19’s firepower as the latter’s combination of McBride’s breakout and Hurts’ leadership secured a convincing 137.3-96.06 victory.

### Tedwood (8-6) 120.32 – 122.1 mavbenson (7-7)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Jameson Williams (DET WR – 26.4 pts), 🎯 Courtland Sutton (DEN WR – 24.3 pts)
Tedwood and mavbenson went toe-to-toe in a nail-biter, with Tedwood’s Josh Allen and Jameson Williams putting up big numbers. Williams’ 26.4 points and Allen’s 24.52 were impressive, but mavbenson’s Courtland Sutton and Ja’Marr Chase combined for nearly 50 points, tipping the scales. It came down to the wire, but mavbenson’s balanced WR assault edged Tedwood 122.1 to 120.32, proving that clutch performances can turn tight games in your favour.
