### K309h (3-8) 93.6 – 164.76 Leviathan35 (8-3)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 35.1 pts), 🏃 TreVeyon Henderson (NE RB – 32.3 pts)
Leviathan35 was cruising with a monstrous backfield showing from Christian McCaffrey (35.1 points) and TreVeyon Henderson (32.3), but shockingly, K309h edged out the upset with 93.6 points. Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Derrick Henry provided solid support, but the big story here is that Leviathan35’s huge day still wasn’t enough to secure the W. K309h’s resilience and timely contributions denied the favourite, proving that fantasy football can be a cruel mistress even on the best days.

### naveb (4-7) 94.82 – 84.04 mavbenson (6-5)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 George Pickens (DAL WR – 29.4 pts), 🏃 Jahmyr Gibbs (DET RB – 19.6 pts)
In a gritty contest, naveb pulled off a tight win over mavbenson, 94.82 to 84.04. George Pickens torched defences with a massive 29.4 points, while Jahmyr Gibbs added a strong 19.6. Despite Deebo Samuel’s 20.7 points and a steady 15.44 from Drake Maye, mavbenson couldn’t quite keep pace. Naveb’s duo combined for nearly half their team’s points, pushing them over the line in a matchup that showcased the power of elite WR and RB performances.

### jacross2000 (5-6) 85.04 – 89.3 Franc19 (7-4)
**Star Performers:** 🧲 Trey McBride (ARI TE – 27.5 pts), 🧠 Jalen Hurts (PHI QB – 14.5 pts)
Franc19 just barely held on against jacross2000, 89.3 to 85.04, thanks largely to a huge day from Trey McBride. The tight end torched defences for 27.5 points, while Jalen Hurts added a modest but helpful 14.5. On the other side, jacross2000 leaned on Puka Nacua and Patrick Mahomes, but their combined output wasn’t quite enough to topple Franc19’s edge. A nail-biter that came down to the wire.

### nlredfern (8-3) 118.24 – 132.26 leejsv (4-7)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Michael Wilson (ARI WR – 33.5 pts), 🏃 Bijan Robinson (ATL RB – 30.3 pts)
leejsv pulled off a tight 132.26-118.24 victory over nlredfern in a thrilling back-and-forth. Michael Wilson’s 33.5 points dazzled, outshining even Bijan Robinson’s 30.3 and Travis Kelce’s 24.1 for nlredfern. The matchup was a showcase of star power on both sides, but leejsv’s WR had the edge, helping his team pull out the win despite the strong effort from the favoured nlredfern squad.

### Tedwood (6-5) 167.98 – 115.22 StatutoryRaitests (4-7)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Josh Allen (BUF QB – 42.68 pts), 🎯 Tetairoa McMillan (CAR WR – 33.0 pts)
Tedwood absolutely steamrolled StatutoryRaitests, 167.98 to 115.22, behind a jaw-dropping 42.68 points from Josh Allen and a huge 33.0 from Tetairoa McMillan. The duo carried the team to a dominant win, overpowering StatutoryRaitests’ solid but insufficient 22 points from Pittsburgh’s defence and 18.9 from Drake London. This was a week where Tedwood’s stars shone so bright, the opposition had no answer.

**Power Pulse**
- 🏆 Big upsets from underdogs K309h and naveb show the league’s unpredictability.
