### K309h (2-7) 122.82 – 155.02 Tedwood (5-4)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Davante Adams (LAR WR – 23.0 pts), 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 22.0 pts)
K309h pulled off a cheeky win despite being underdogs against Tedwood, who actually racked up a massive 155.02 points led by Brock Bowers’ jaw-dropping 43.3 points and Josh Allen’s 28.82. But it was K309h’s dynamic duo of Davante Adams and Jaxon Smith-Njigba combining for 45 points that made the difference. Tedwood’s star power was undeniable, but K309h’s balanced attack and deeper roster firepower edged out a higher-scoring opponent. A classic case of fantasy football’s unpredictability where volume and timing trump sheer points.

### naveb (3-6) 137.46 – 108.82 Leviathan35 (6-3)
**Star Performers:** 🧲 Colston Loveland (CHI TE – 29.8 pts), 🧠 Lamar Jackson (BAL QB – 25.56 pts)
In a clash of contenders, naveb upset Leviathan35 thanks to an explosive week from Colston Loveland who torched defences with nearly 30 points. Lamar Jackson’s dual-threat prowess added another 25.5 points, helping to neutralise Leviathan35’s Christian McCaffrey who still put up a mighty 34.3. Unfortunately for Leviathan35, Jayden Daniels couldn’t match the firepower, leaving their offence short. This win keeps naveb’s faint playoff hopes alive and serves a warning that Leviathan35 can be beaten with the right matchups.

### jacross2000 (5-4) 118.8 – 108.36 mavbenson (5-4)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Puka Nacua (LAR WR – 22.8 pts), 🧲 Sam LaPorta (DET TE – 21.7 pts)
jacross2000 edged out a tight contest with mavbenson thanks to the breakout performances of Puka Nacua and Sam LaPorta. Their combined 44.5 points made the difference against mavbenson’s Ja'Marr Chase and Jaylen Warren, who had solid but not spectacular weeks. This one was a classic fantasy shootout, but jacross2000’s depth at WR and TE shone through, proving balanced scoring often beats relying on a few stars.

### nlredfern (7-2) 130.1 – 147.6 StatutoryRaitests (3-6)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Justin Herbert (LAC QB – 27.7 pts), 🎯 Michael Pittman (IND WR – 20.5 pts)
Despite a strong showing from Justin Herbert and Michael Pittman, nlredfern was toppled by an electric performance from StatutoryRaitests, who leaned on Drake London’s massive 38.8 points and Sam Darnold’s near 30-point effort. The upset highlights how one massive WR explosion can swing fantasy outcomes, even against a top-ranked team like nlredfern. It’s a reminder that no lead is safe when opponents have a weapon like London firing on all cylinders.

### Franc19 (6-3) 116.64 – 102.02 leejsv (3-6)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Matthew Stafford (LAR QB – 26.84 pts), 🎯 Rashee Rice (KC WR – 18.6 pts)
Franc19 held firm against leejsv, thanks largely to Matthew Stafford’s efficient 26.8 points and Rashee Rice’s reliable 18.6. Despite strong performances from leejsv’s Marvin Harrison and Amon-Ra St. Brown, neither could quite outpace Franc19’s balanced attack. This was a solid, controlled win for Franc19 that keeps their playoff push on track while reminding us that consistency beats flash in tight matchups.

**Power Pulse**
- 🏆 Underdogs K309h and naveb score big upsets against higher-ranked foes.
- • Tight battles highlight the value of balanced scoring over single-star reliance.
