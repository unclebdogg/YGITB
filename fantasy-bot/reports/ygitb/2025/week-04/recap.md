### K309h (0-4) 147.14 – 152.08 leejsv (2-2)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Josh Jacobs (GB RB – 31.7 pts), 🧠 Bo Nix (DEN QB – 25.74 pts)
K309h’s Josh Jacobs bulldozed through Green Bay’s defense for a massive 31.7-point haul — the kind of performance that could turn a season around. Denver’s Bo Nix also delivered a surprise QB gem, adding 25.74 points to keep the scoreboard ticking. Despite Jordan Love and Amon-Ra St. Brown lighting it up for leejsv with 26.28 and 26 points respectively, it wasn’t quite enough to overcome K309h’s balanced attack. The margin was tight, but K309h’s late-game surge handed leejsv a tough loss, keeping the winless streak alive but competitive.

### naveb (2-2) 133.98 – 183.3 jacross2000 (2-2)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 George Pickens (DAL WR – 33.4 pts), 🎯 Emeka Egbuka (TB WR – 20.1 pts)
Despite jacross2000 dropping a whopping 183.3 points led by Puka Nacua’s 36 and Ashton Jeanty’s 33.5, naveb’s George Pickens stole the show with a dazzling 33.4-point explosion for Dallas, complemented by Emeka Egbuka’s reliable 20.1 points. It was a classic case of high-scoring fireworks but naveb’s stars came up clutch enough to claim the win. This one was a shootout where Pickens’ big plays made all the difference, proving sometimes quality beats quantity in fantasy battles.

### mavbenson (1-3) 115.08 – 133.26 StatutoryRaitests (2-2)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Bucky Irving (TB RB – 25.5 pts), 🎯 Quentin Johnston (LAC WR – 23.8 pts)
In a matchup that looked like a StatutoryRaitests win with 133 points, mavbenson’s Bucky Irving and Quentin Johnston rose to the occasion with 25.5 and 23.8 points respectively, pushing their side to a gritty 115.08-point victory. StatutoryRaitests leaned heavily on Drake London and Justin Jefferson, but a lack of depth kept them just short. Mavbenson’s combo of Irving’s steady ground game and Johnston’s electric receiving made the difference when it mattered most.

### Leviathan35 (3-1) 102.38 – 122.82 nlredfern (3-1)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 26.1 pts), 🎯 Nico Collins (HOU WR – 11.9 pts)
Leviathan35’s Christian McCaffrey was a fantasy force with 26.1 points, but it wasn’t quite enough to topple nlredfern’s balanced attack. Bijan Robinson and Omarion Hampton combined for over 55 points, powering nlredfern to a solid 122.82 total. Nico Collins chipped in 11.9 for Leviathan35 but the lack of support elsewhere left them short. This one was a reminder that even a superstar like McCaffrey needs help to seal the deal against a well-rounded opponent.

### Tedwood (2-2) 96.16 – 103.3 Franc19 (3-1)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Josh Allen (BUF QB – 24.86 pts), 🏃 Zach Charbonnet (SEA RB – 12.4 pts)
Tedwood’s Josh Allen was the prime mover with nearly 25 points, outpacing Franc19’s Jalen Hurts who had 19.4. Zach Charbonnet added a modest but crucial 12.4 points to help Tedwood scrape out a 96.16 to 103.3 win in a low-scoring affair. Franc19’s Quinshon Judkins posted a solid 21.5 points, but the overall output wasn’t enough to topple Tedwood’s QB-led attack. This one was a gritty grind where every point counted, and Tedwood’s stars delivered just enough.

**Power Pulse**
- 🏆 Josh Jacobs and Bo Nix are suddenly fantasy darlings for K309h — watch this space.
- • High-scoring losses sting, but jacross2000’s Puka Nacua and Ashton Jeanty lit up the scoreboard with monster weeks.
- • McCaffrey remains a fantasy titan, but without strong support, even he can’t carry Leviathan35 past the 100-point mark.
