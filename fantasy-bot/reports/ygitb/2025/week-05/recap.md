**Star Performers:** 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 27.2 pts), 🏃 Jonathan Taylor (IND RB – 31.6 pts)
K309h defied the odds and their winless record by squeaking past mavbenson 123.88 to 129.32 in a nail-biter. Jaxon Smith-Njigba was electric, hauling in big points for K309h with 27.2, while Bo Nix added solid support. Despite mavbenson’s Jonathan Taylor torching the scoreboard with a monster 31.6 points and Ja'Marr Chase lighting it up with 29, it wasn’t quite enough. K309h’s balanced attack and timely plays kept them just ahead in this thriller, proving a 0-5 tag doesn’t mean you’re down for the count.

### naveb (2-3) 114.38 – 123.02 leejsv (3-2)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Emeka Egbuka (TB WR – 31.3 pts), 🧠 Justin Fields (NYJ QB – 25.92 pts)
In a clash of emerging stars, naveb’s Emeka Egbuka exploded with 31.3 points, proving a WR breakout that leejsv struggled to contain. Jahmyr Gibbs chipped in with 16.7 points, giving naveb the edge in depth. Leejsv’s Justin Fields threw a strong 25.92 points and Jake Ferguson’s 23.9 kept the game close, but they just couldn’t outpace Egbuka’s electric production. This win nudges naveb closer to respectability while leaving leejsv to ponder missed chances in a tight affair.

### jacross2000 (3-2) 162.52 – 155.4 StatutoryRaitests (2-3)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Javonte Williams (DAL RB – 26.9 pts), 🏃 Kyren Williams (LAR RB – 31.1 pts)
This high-scoring barnburner saw jacross2000 narrowly outscore StatutoryRaitests 162.52 to 155.4 thanks largely to Javonte Williams’ punishing 26.9 points and Patrick Mahomes’ steady 26.72. StatutoryRaitests wasn’t far behind with Kyren Williams’ 31.1 and Stefon Diggs’ 24.6 lighting up the stat sheet. The duel of Williams RBs was a sight to behold, but Mahomes’ magic tipped the scales, pushing jacross2000 to a crucial victory in this shootout.

### Leviathan35 (4-1) 138.54 – 80.32 Tedwood (2-3)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Rico Dowdle (CAR RB – 32.4 pts), 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 27.9 pts)
Leviathan35 flexed serious muscle, steamrolling Tedwood 138.54 to 80.32 behind a dominant Carolina-Carolina RB combo. Rico Dowdle racked up a massive 32.4 points while Christian McCaffrey added a hefty 27.9, making this one-sided affair look easy. Tedwood’s Josh Allen, usually a reliable fantasy workhorse, was kept in check with just 19.42 points, while Tetairoa McMillan failed to ignite. Leviathan35’s crushing ground game was simply too much to handle.

### nlredfern (4-1) 98.14 – 98.1 Franc19 (3-2)
**Star Performers:** 🧲 Travis Kelce (KC TE – 19.1 pts), 🧠 Jalen Hurts (PHI QB – 19.5 pts)
Talk about a heartbreaker! nlredfern edged Franc19 by a razor-thin 0.04 points in a tense duel decided by Travis Kelce’s reliable 19.1 points and De'Von Achane’s solid 16.6. Franc19’s Jalen Hurts put up a strong 19.5 and Saquon Barkley added 17.8, but a quieter day from Kelce’s Philly counterparts allowed Kelce to be the difference maker. This one could’ve swung either way, but nlredfern’s tightrope walk held firm.
