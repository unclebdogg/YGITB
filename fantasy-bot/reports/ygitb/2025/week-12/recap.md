**Star Performers:** 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 37.1 pts), 🧠 Jalen Hurts (PHI QB – 30.86 pts)

Despite a stunning 37.1-point effort from K309h’s Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the home team couldn’t match the sheer firepower of Franc19. Davante Adams chipped in a solid 23.2 points, but it wasn’t enough to prevent a lopsided scoreline. K309h’s upset hopes were dashed early as Franc19’s balanced attack steamrolled to victory.

### naveb (5-7) 153.32 – 92.12 Tedwood (6-6)

Jahmyr Gibbs absolutely exploded for a massive 55.4 points, lighting the way for naveb’s dominant win over Tedwood. George Pickens also torched the scoreboard with 29.6 points, while Tedwood’s Kenneth Walker and Cleveland defense couldn’t keep pace. The disparity was stark as naveb’s offence clicked on all cylinders and Tedwood’s usually reliable players failed to find their rhythm. This one was never close — a true statement win for naveb.

### jacross2000 (5-7) 94.58 – 132.58 Leviathan35 (9-3)

Despite Patrick Mahomes’ steady 17.08 points and Ashton Jeanty’s 24.8-point effort, jacross2000 couldn’t close the gap. The underdog fought valiantly but Leviathan35’s balanced backfield and solid QB play sealed the deal, maintaining their spot near the top of the table.

### mavbenson (6-6) 84.86 – 139.86 nlredfern (9-3)
**Star Performers:** 🛡️ Atlanta (ATL DEF – 16.0 pts), 🧠 Dak Prescott (DAL QB – 27.06 pts)
nlredfern’s powerful offense, led by Dak Prescott’s 27.06 points and A.J. Brown’s 25, looked set to cruise. However, mavbenson’s Atlanta defense came up big with 16 points, disrupting plays and keeping the contest competitive. Drake Maye’s 15.96 points also helped mavbenson hang tough. Though nlredfern won decisively, mavbenson’s defensive stand prevented an even wider blowout, showcasing the importance of defense in fantasy success.

### StatutoryRaitests (4-8) 74.94 – 143.26 leejsv (5-7)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Chris Olave (NO WR – 16.0 pts), 🎯 Amon-Ra St. Brown (DET WR – 29.9 pts)
