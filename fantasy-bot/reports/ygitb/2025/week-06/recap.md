### K309h (1-5) 174.76 – 127.44 StatutoryRaitests (2-4)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Josh Jacobs (GB RB – 32.0 pts), 🏃 Cam Skattebo (NYG RB – 31.0 pts)
K309h finally found their rhythm in Week 6, powered by a ground assault from Josh Jacobs and Cam Skattebo who combined for 63 points. Jacobs delivered a steady 32, while Skattebo's breakout 31 points added serious punch. Meanwhile, StatutoryRaitests leaned on Drake London and Baker Mayfield, but despite London's impressive 31.8 points, it wasn't quite enough to keep pace. Mayfield's 19.64 points fell short of the ceiling needed to close the gap. K309h's dominant running game proved the difference, turning their season around with a confident statement win.

### naveb (2-4) 110.1 – 151.94 nlredfern (5-1)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 George Pickens (DAL WR – 31.8 pts), 🧠 Jaxson Dart (NYG QB – 23.6 pts)
In a surprising twist, naveb toppled the top-ranked nlredfern, riding big weeks from George Pickens and Jaxson Dart. Pickens torched defenses for 31.8 points, while Dart added a solid 23.6 points under centre. Despite Bijan Robinson's monster 35.8 and De'Von Achane's 31 points for nlredfern, the overall team effort wasn't enough to hold off naveb's balanced attack. This upset shakes the standings, showing that even the frontrunners can be vulnerable when a couple of stars catch fire.

### jacross2000 (3-3) 103.68 – 105.7 Tedwood (3-3)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Patrick Mahomes (KC QB – 31.48 pts), 🏃 Ashton Jeanty (LV RB – 16.6 pts)
Tedwood clinched a razor-thin victory over jacross2000, edging out by just under two points. Mahomes dazzled with 31.48 points for jacross2000, and Jeanty chipped in a handy 16.6, but it wasn’t quite enough against Tedwood’s strong defensive showing from the LAR unit and Jameson Williams’ 18.6 points. The Los Angeles defense’s 19 points proved crucial in the tight finish, helping Tedwood hold on in a classic down-to-the-wire matchup.

### mavbenson (3-3) 136.84 – 99.62 Franc19 (3-3)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Drake Maye (NE QB – 27.24 pts), 🎯 Ja'Marr Chase (CIN WR – 25.1 pts)
mavbenson cruised to a comfortable win over Franc19, with Drake Maye and Ja'Marr Chase combining for over 50 points. Maye’s 27.24 points led the charge, while Chase’s 25.1 kept the scoreboard ticking. Franc19’s Trey McBride and Jalen Hurts put up respectable numbers, but the deficit was too steep. Maye’s fresh QB spark and Chase’s reliable hands made the difference, outpacing Franc19’s balanced but less explosive attack.

### Leviathan35 (5-1) 142.64 – 91.86 leejsv (3-3)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Rico Dowdle (CAR RB – 33.9 pts), 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 24.1 pts)
Leviathan35 remains red-hot, dismantling leejsv behind a punishing RB duo of Rico Dowdle and Christian McCaffrey. Dowdle’s monster 33.9 points and McCaffrey’s 24.1 made running the ball look easy. Leejsv’s Brian Thomas and Jordan Love fought valiantly but couldn’t match the ground game dominance. This win solidifies Leviathan35’s status as a top contender, with a balanced attack that’s tough to stop.
