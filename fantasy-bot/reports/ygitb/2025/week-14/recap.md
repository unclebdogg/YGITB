**Star Performers:** 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 28.1 pts), 🧠 Jacoby Brissett (ARI QB – 19.04 pts)
K309h pulled off a gritty 106.28-100.04 win over mavbenson in a tight contest. The difference-maker was Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who torched the turf for 28.1 points, giving K309h the edge on the receiving end. Josh Jacobs chipped in solidly with 17.2 points, helping to offset mavbenson’s strong showing from Jacoby Brissett, who threw up 19.04 points. Bucky Irving’s 16.1 points kept mavbenson in the hunt, but it wasn’t quite enough as K309h’s balanced attack just edged out the 7-7 squad.

### naveb (6-8) 144.36 – 143.26 leejsv (5-9)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Jahmyr Gibbs (DET RB – 37.0 pts), 🎯 Michael Wilson (ARI WR – 37.2 pts)
What a thriller! naveb narrowly squeezed past leejsv 144.36 to 143.26, with both sides lighting up the scoreboard. Jahmyr Gibbs was a beast for naveb, rumbling for a massive 37 points and setting the tone on the ground. Tee Higgins added a hefty 27.2 points, creating a potent combo. But leejsv wasn’t backing down, with Michael Wilson exploding for 37.2 points to keep it neck and neck alongside RJ Harvey’s 22.0 points. In the end, naveb’s RB power just edged out the fierce WR assault from leejsv.

### jacross2000 (7-7) 116.3 – 93.18 StatutoryRaitests (4-10)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Puka Nacua (LAR WR – 35.7 pts), 🎯 Cameron Dicker (LAC K – 20.0 pts)
jacross2000 cruised to a 116.3-93.18 victory over StatutoryRaitests, largely thanks to Puka Nacua’s breakout 35.7 points on the receiving end. Zay Flowers also contributed a strong 20.6 points, giving jacross2000 a lethal WR duo. StatutoryRaitests’ Cameron Dicker kicked well, scoring 20 points, but the team’s offense just couldn’t match the firepower. Kyren Williams’ 17.7 points were solid but not enough to keep pace with jacross2000’s aerial assault.

### Leviathan35 (9-5) 118.46 – 137.64 Tedwood (8-6)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Christian Watson (GB WR – 24.9 pts), 🧠 Josh Allen (BUF QB – 37.84 pts)
Tedwood’s Josh Allen had a monster day, lighting up the scoreboard with 37.84 points, but it wasn’t quite enough to top Leviathan35’s balanced attack. Christian Watson’s 24.9 points and Joe Burrow’s 23.36 combined to push Leviathan35 to a 137.64-118.46 win. While Tedwood’s Brandon Aubrey nailed 24 points on the boot, the overall offensive output from Leviathan35 was just too strong, showing the value of spreading the load across multiple stars rather than relying on a single explosive performance.

### nlredfern (11-3) 142.14 – 69.6 Franc19 (8-6)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 DK Metcalf (PIT WR – 21.8 pts), 🏃 Saquon Barkley (PHI RB – 18.2 pts)
nlredfern flexed hard in a dominant 142.14-69.6 demolition of Franc19. DK Metcalf and Travis Etienne each delivered over 20 points, powering a well-rounded assault that overwhelmed the opposition. Franc19’s Saquon Barkley put up a respectable 18.2 points, but Jakobi Meyers’ 14.8 points couldn’t bridge the massive gap. This one was all about nlredfern’s potent offence firing on all cylinders and Franc19 struggling to keep pace.

**Power Pulse**
- 🏆 Close calls everywhere — three games decided by under 10 points! Fantasy league drama at its finest.
- • Jahmyr Gibbs and Puka Nacua emerged as Week 14’s breakout stars, each smashing 35+ points.
- • Despite Josh Allen’s heroics, balanced attacks with multiple contributors proved the winning formula.
