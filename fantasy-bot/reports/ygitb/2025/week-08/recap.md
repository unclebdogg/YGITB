### K309h (2-6) 121.68 – 142.48 nlredfern (7-1)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Bo Nix (DEN QB – 23.78 pts), 🎯 Ladd McConkey (LAC WR – 20.8 pts)
K309h shocked the league by toppling the heavy favourite nlredfern despite the latter’s solid 142.48 points. Bo Nix’s 23.78 points brought steady QB production while Ladd McConkey’s 20.8 points made a huge splash in this tight contest. Meanwhile, nlredfern's Justin Herbert and Michael Pittman put up strong numbers (25.28 and 23.5 respectively), but it wasn’t enough to hold off K309h’s balanced attack. A close call that proves no lead is safe when the underdog brings the heat.

### naveb (2-6) 142.12 – 161.36 Franc19 (5-3)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Chase Brown (CIN RB – 25.5 pts), 🎯 Chris Boswell (PIT K – 20 pts)
naveb pulled off a gutsy victory against Franc19 in a game where Saquon Barkley exploded for 33.4 points. Despite the Philly star's brilliance and Tampa Bay's defensive 28 points, it was Chase Brown’s reliable 25.5 points and Boswell’s clutch 20 points on the boot that sealed the deal. Franc19’s high-scoring effort wasn’t quite enough to fend off the determined underdog, who keeps fighting in the thick of the pack.

### jacross2000 (4-4) 145.76 – 121.7 leejsv (3-5)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Patrick Mahomes (KC QB – 22.96 pts), 🎯 Jaylen Waddle (MIA WR – 20.9 pts)
jacross2000’s dynamic duo of Mahomes and Waddle combined for nearly 44 points to outgun leejsv’s powerful duo of Cook and Love. Despite James Cook’s monster 33.6 points and Love’s 28.3, jacross2000’s balanced attack proved more consistent. Mahomes’ leadership and Waddle’s explosive plays kept the scoreboard ticking and secured a comfortable 24-point victory in this back-and-forth affair.

### mavbenson (5-3) 135.28 – 97.22 Tedwood (4-4)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Jonathan Taylor (IND RB – 37.4 pts), 🧠 Drake Maye (NE QB – 26.28 pts)
Jonathan Taylor was an absolute beast, racking up 37.4 points to lead mavbenson to a decisive win over Tedwood. Drake Maye’s 26.28 points at QB also provided a huge boost. Tedwood’s Josh Allen was solid but quiet by his standards with 23.22 points, and Oronde Gadsden didn’t have the breakout game needed to keep pace. This one was all about Taylor’s dominance and mavbenson’s well-rounded attack putting the clamps on a frustrated opponent.

### Leviathan35 (6-2) 105.7 – 101.44 StatutoryRaitests (2-6)
**Star Performers:** 🧲 Tucker Kraft (GB TE – 33.3 pts), 🏃 Kimani Vidal (LAC RB – 19.7 pts)
In a nail-biter finish, Leviathan35 edged out StatutoryRaitests by just over four points. Tucker Kraft’s monster 33.3 points at tight end proved the difference-maker, outshining a strong 32.86 points from Breece Hall on the other side. Kimani Vidal’s 19.7 points added crucial depth for Leviathan35. Despite Dallas Goedert and Hall’s efforts, it was Kraft’s standout performance that tipped the scales in this tightly contested duel.
