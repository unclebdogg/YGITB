### naveb (6-3) 176.74 – 120.46 warkha (3-6)
**Star Performers:** 🧲 Brock Bowers (LV TE – 43.3 pts), 🎯 Tee Higgins (CIN WR – 33.1 pts)
naveb flexed some serious muscle this week, spearheaded by the unstoppable Brock Bowers who piled up a jaw-dropping 43.3 points. Tee Higgins chimed in with a hefty 33.1 points, making it a one-two punch that warkha simply couldn't match. Despite Rashee Rice and Drake Maye putting up decent numbers for warkha, their combined effort wasn't enough to keep pace with naveb's firepower. This dominant display cements naveb’s spot near the top, while warkha will need to regroup after getting steamrolled.

### jacross2000 (1-8) 77.92 – 103.22 JamesHanlin (5-4)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Rico Dowdle (CAR RB – 28.1 pts), 🎯 Ja'Marr Chase (CIN WR – 17.1 pts)
JamesHanlin looked to be cruising with standout performances from Rico Dowdle and Ja'Marr Chase putting up solid points. Meanwhile, jacross2000 leaned on Amon-Ra St. Brown and James Cook, but their effort was just shy of bridging the gap. The 25-point margin tells the story: JamesHanlin’s stars shone brighter, snapping their skid, while jacross2000 remains stuck in the doldrums.

### mavbenson (6-3) 136.42 – 127.32 Mheineger (3-6)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Davante Adams (LAR WR – 23.0 pts), 🏃 Kyle Monangai (CHI RB – 22.8 pts)
This one was a thriller right down to the wire. Mheineger’s Josh Allen and Marvin Harrison lit up the scoreboard, but mavbenson’s Davante Adams and Kyle Monangai just edged them out. The 9-point difference highlights how close it was — a true nail-biter. Mavbenson’s balanced attack with reliable stars made the difference in this tight tussle, while Mheineger can hold their heads high despite the narrow loss.

### RedCordial (6-3) 103.6 – 96.3 Dell2620 (6-3)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 34.3 pts), 🏃 Ashton Jeanty (LV RB – 19.9 pts)
RedCordial leaned heavily on the electric Christian McCaffrey who delivered a massive 34.3 points, with Ashton Jeanty also stepping up to push past Dell2620. Despite strong showings from Michael Pittman and CeeDee Lamb, Dell2620 just couldn’t quite close the gap. This win keeps RedCordial firmly in the playoff hunt, while Dell2620 faces a tough loss in a closely fought battle.

### Wastingtime02 (4-5) 112.78 – 117.76 leftovername (4-5)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Lamar Jackson (BAL QB – 25.56 pts), 🎯 Ka'imi Fairbairn (HOU K – 17.0 pts)
In a close-as-it-gets showdown, leftovername edged out Wastingtime02 by just under 5 points. Lamar Jackson’s 25.56 points led the charge, backed by Ka'imi Fairbairn’s reliable kicking. Wastingtime02’s Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the Pittsburgh defense put up a solid fight, but it wasn’t quite enough to flip the result. Both sides showed fight, but leftovername grabbed the crucial win in this nail-biter.

### NickDagan (8-1) 97.7 – 93.0 TheMianimal (2-7)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Justin Herbert (LAC QB – 28.7 pts), 🎯 Romeo Doubs (GB WR – 16.1 pts)
NickDagan clung to a slim lead with Justin Herbert leading the way, posting a clutch 28.7 points that just barely outpaced TheMianimal’s Sam Darnold. Romeo Doubs also chipped in nicely, helping NickDagan maintain their strong season record. TheMianimal fought hard with Kyren Williams showing promise, but ultimately fell short in a tight contest that could have gone either way.
