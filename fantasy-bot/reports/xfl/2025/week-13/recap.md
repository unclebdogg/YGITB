### naveb (9-4) 143.26 – 103.64 mavbenson (7-6)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Bijan Robinson (ATL RB – 30.3 pts), 🎯 Evan McPherson (CIN K – 24.0 pts)
naveb’s 143.26 points were propelled by Bijan Robinson’s monster 30.3-point ground assault and Evan McPherson’s reliable booting for 24 points. This combo obliterated mavbenson’s defense, despite Davante Adams putting up a solid 21.8 points and Bo Nix adding 17.44. The difference? Bijan’s explosive runs and McPherson’s clutch field goals kept the scoreboard ticking, creating a comfortable buffer for naveb’s dominant Week 13 performance.

### jacross2000 (2-11) 102.56 – 121.92 Mheineger (5-8)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Jordan Love (GB QB – 25.76 pts), 🏃 James Cook (BUF RB – 18.7 pts)
Despite a valiant effort from Mheineger’s Jameson Williams (26.9 points) and D'Andre Swift (20.8), jacross2000’s Jordan Love threw a dart with 25.76 points, paired with James Cook’s consistent 18.7, to keep the scoreboard ticking. This effort was enough for jacross2000 to squeak past Mheineger in a matchup where star power battled but ultimately the QBs precision and RB reliability won out.

### RedCordial (7-6) 94.8 – 92.82 Wastingtime02 (5-8)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Dak Prescott (DAL QB – 21.6 pts), 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 17.4 pts)
In a nail-biter, RedCordial edged out Wastingtime02 by less than two points. Dak Prescott’s 21.6 points and Christian McCaffrey’s steady 17.4 proved just enough against Derrick Henry and Courtland Sutton’s near-equal output. It was a classic quarterback vs. running back showdown, with Prescott’s passing magic tipping the scales in RedCordial’s favour.

### Dell2620 (8-5) 79.9 – 103.56 TheMianimal (4-9)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 CeeDee Lamb (DAL WR – 24.2 pts), 🏃 Devin Singletary (NYG RB – 19.2 pts)
TheMianimal’s 103.56 points were fueled by a surprising Jason Myers’ 19 points booting effort and Kyle Pitts’ 15.2 points at tight end, but Dell2620’s CeeDee Lamb (24.2) and Devin Singletary (19.2) shone bright. Despite the loss, Dell2620’s stars produced big numbers, but TheMianimal’s well-rounded contributions edged them out in this one.

### NickDagan (11-2) 120.84 – 174.38 warkha (7-6)
**Star Performers:** 🛡️ Seattle (SEA DEF – 32.0 pts), 🏃 Javonte Williams (DAL RB – 17.0 pts)
In a fireworks display, warkha’s A.J. Brown exploded for 35.2 points and Rashee Rice added 29.4, demolishing NickDagan’s solid Seattle Defense (32 points) and Javonte Williams (17). Despite NickDagan’s strong defensive effort and steady RB production, the sheer volume of points from warkha’s star receivers created a blowout, handing NickDagan a rare loss in Week 13.

### leftovername (5-8) 70.34 – 102.44 JamesHanlin (8-5)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Breece Hall (NYJ RB – 15.6 pts), 🧲 Travis Kelce (KC TE – 15.5 pts)
JamesHanlin’s Joe Burrow (19.24) and Ja'Marr Chase (18) outpaced leftovername’s Breece Hall (15.6) and Travis Kelce (15.5) in a matchup where leftovername’s stars couldn’t quite keep pace. Kelce’s quiet week by his standards limited leftovername’s ceiling, allowing JamesHanlin to cruise to victory with a balanced passing attack.
