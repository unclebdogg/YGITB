### naveb (2-0) 107.68 – 105.62 mavbenson (1-1)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Bijan Robinson (ATL RB – 19.8 pts), 🎯 George Pickens (DAL WR – 17.8 pts)
In a nail-biter, naveb held on to a slim 2-point win over mavbenson. Bijan Robinson’s consistent 19.8 points on the ground provided the steady foundation, while George Pickens chipped in with a solid 17.8 points through the air. Despite mavbenson’s Puka Nacua torching defenses for 27.6 points and Tyreek Hill adding 16.9, it wasn’t quite enough to overcome the balanced attack from naveb. A classic close call where Robinson’s reliability made all the difference.

### jacross2000 (1-1) 138.3 – 101.92 Mheineger (0-2)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Amon-Ra St. Brown (DET WR – 39.2 pts), 🏃 James Cook (BUF RB – 26.5 pts)
jacross2000 dominated this one behind a monster 39.2-point explosion from Amon-Ra St. Brown, who was absolutely untouchable. James Cook’s 26.5 points on the ground added a lethal second punch. Mheineger had some defensive highlights with Baltimore’s unit scoring 16 points and Nick Chubb’s 15.2, but the gap was too wide. This was a clinic in WR dominance and balanced attack from jacross2000.

### RedCordial (1-1) 107.24 – 102.74 Wastingtime02 (0-2)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Rome Odunze (CHI WR – 31.8 pts), 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 22.7 pts)
RedCordial squeezed out a close win over Wastingtime02 in a shootout. Rome Odunze’s 31.8 points led the charge, complemented by Christian McCaffrey’s reliable 22.7. Wastingtime02’s Malik Nabers nearly stole the show with a massive 37.7 points and Daniel Jones threw in 22.84, but it wasn’t enough on this day. RedCordial’s combo of WR and RB firepower proved just a touch too strong.

### Dell2620 (2-0) 115.94 – 98.28 TheMianimal (1-1)
**Star Performers:** 🧲 Tucker Kraft (GB TE – 24.4 pts), 🎯 CeeDee Lamb (DAL WR – 20.2 pts)
Dell2620’s TE Tucker Kraft was the X-factor with a strong 24.4 points, helping secure a comfortable win against TheMianimal. CeeDee Lamb’s 20.2 points added nice balance. TheMianimal’s Caleb Williams and Saquon Barkley put up respectable numbers but couldn’t keep pace. This one was about Dell2620 leveraging a less typical position for big gains, showing the value of a standout TE.

### NickDagan (2-0) 114.78 – 105.6 warkha (0-2)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Javonte Williams (DAL RB – 25 pts), 🏃 Jahmyr Gibbs (DET RB – 19.4 pts)
NickDagan’s running backs stole the show, with Javonte Williams’ 25 points and Jahmyr Gibbs’ 19.4 pushing past warkha’s strong effort. Drake Maye and De'Von Achane both lit it up with over 26 points each, but the RB duo’s consistency ultimately made the difference. This was a prime example of how a dominant ground game can edge out flashy QB performances.

**Power Pulse**
- 🏆 Early season form is shaping up—naveb and NickDagan now perfect at 2-0.
- • Amon-Ra St. Brown and Malik Nabers are WRs to watch after huge weeks.
- • Tucker Kraft’s TE breakout shows fantasy gold can come from anywhere on the field.
