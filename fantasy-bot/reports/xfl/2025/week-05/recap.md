### naveb (3-2) 88.38 – 134.74 NickDagan (5-0)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Justin Fields (NYJ QB – 25.92 pts), 🏃 Javonte Williams (DAL RB – 26.9 pts)
NickDagan’s unbeaten run came to a screeching halt despite Javonte Williams and Jake Ferguson putting up monster numbers (26.9 and 23.9 points respectively). Meanwhile, naveb leaned on Justin Fields’ dynamic 25.92 points and Jordan Addison’s steady 15.1 to keep pace but ultimately couldn’t match the firepower. The offense sputtered just enough to hand the upset to NickDagan, who saw his perfect season spoiled in a game where the stars shone bright but consistency was key.

### jacross2000 (1-4) 103.26 – 127.58 mavbenson (3-2)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Baker Mayfield (TB QB – 26.66 pts), 🎯 Puka Nacua (LAR WR – 24.5 pts)
Mavbenson’s balanced attack with Puka Nacua and Rachaad White firing big (24.5 and 23.1 points) was just too much for jacross2000, despite Baker Mayfield’s impressive 26.66 points and Amon-Ra St. Brown’s 18.0. The clash featured plenty of big plays, but mavbenson’s star power and depth proved decisive in this one, handing jacross2000 another tough loss in what’s been a challenging season so far.

### RedCordial (4-1) 143.38 – 127.06 TheMianimal (2-3)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Emeka Egbuka (TB WR – 31.3 pts), 🏃 Kyren Williams (LAR RB – 31.1 pts)
RedCordial dominated thanks to Emeka Egbuka’s explosive 31.3 points and Dak Prescott’s steady 28.28, outpacing TheMianimal’s Kyren Williams and Sam Darnold who also lit it up with 31.1 and 28.64 points. This high-scoring shootout showcased star talent on both sides, but RedCordial’s superior WR firepower and offensive balance was just enough to claim the victory and keep their strong record intact.

### Dell2620 (5-0) 108.8 – 107.12 warkha (1-4)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Jaylen Waddle (MIA WR – 23.0 pts), 🧠 Jared Goff (DET QB – 20.12 pts)
Dell2620 barely clung to their undefeated record in a nail-biter against warkha, eking out a 1.68-point win. Jaylen Waddle’s 23.0 points and Jalen Hurts’ 19.5 were just enough to overcome Jared Goff’s impressive 20.12 and De’Von Achane’s 16.6. The margin was wafer-thin, highlighting how every point counted in this thriller that could’ve gone either way.

### Wastingtime02 (2-3) 128.68 – 128.64 JamesHanlin (1-4)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 27.2 pts), 🏃 Jonathan Taylor (IND RB – 31.6 pts)
In one of the tightest contests of the week, Wastingtime02 edged JamesHanlin by a mere 0.04 points! Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s 27.2 points and David Njoku’s 18.7 just barely outpaced Jonathan Taylor’s monster 31.6 and Ja’Marr Chase’s 29.0. This match was a heartbreaker for JamesHanlin, who saw a huge performance fall just short in a game that went down to the wire.

### leftovername (2-3) 146.54 – 70.22 Mheineger (1-4)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Stefon Diggs (NE WR – 24.6 pts), 🧠 Josh Allen (BUF QB – 20.42 pts)
Leftovername absolutely steamrolled Mheineger in a blowout fueled by Stefon Diggs’ 24.6 points and Tua Tagovailoa’s solid 22.74. Josh Allen and Nick Chubb couldn’t keep pace, with Allen’s 20.42 points overshadowed by the sheer volume of leftovername’s scoring. Mheineger’s struggles continued as they were left gasping for answers against this high-powered assault.

**Power Pulse**
- 🏆 Close calls defined Week 5, with multiple games decided by fewer than 2 points.
- • Top-tier WRs and QBs carried teams, but RBs like Javonte Williams and Jonathan Taylor kept the pressure high.
- • Underdogs showed grit, but consistency and star performances still separate the contenders from the pretenders.
