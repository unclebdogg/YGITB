### naveb (7-3) 80.88 – 79.42 Dell2620 (6-4)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Jaxson Dart (NYG QB – 26.28 pts), 🎯 Jaylen Waddle (MIA WR – 19.4 pts)
In a nail-biter, naveb edged out Dell2620 by just 1.46 points, thanks largely to Jaxson Dart’s 26.28 points at QB. Dart's steady arm and key throws kept the scoreboard ticking, while Parker Washington's 17.9 points added crucial support. Dell2620’s Jaylen Waddle was electric with 19.4 points, matched closely by Juwan Johnson's 19.2 at TE, but it wasn’t quite enough to topple the 7-3 squad. This tight finish shows how every point counts in the league’s midseason battles.

### jacross2000 (1-9) 84.72 – 132.8 warkha (4-6)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 De'Von Achane (MIA RB – 40.5 pts), 🧠 Baker Mayfield (TB QB – 22.92 pts)
Despite a monstrous 40.5 points from De'Von Achane, warkha couldn’t convert their firepower into a win, falling to jacross2000. Baker Mayfield’s 22.92 points and Amon-Ra St. Brown’s reliable 16.8 gave jacross2000 the edge, proving that balanced scoring trumps a solo explosion. The 1-9 underdog snagged a morale-boosting win, while warkha’s Trey McBride also posted a strong 27.7 points but it wasn’t enough to overcome the collective effort.

### mavbenson (6-4) 123.1 – 127.82 JamesHanlin (6-4)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Jonathan Taylor (IND RB – 49.6 pts), 🏃 TreVeyon Henderson (NE RB – 28.0 pts)
A heavyweight fantasy clash saw JamesHanlin just hold off mavbenson in a high-scoring thriller. Jonathan Taylor’s jaw-dropping 49.6 points almost carried JamesHanlin to a blowout, but mavbenson’s TreVeyon Henderson and Davante Adams combined for nearly 48 points to keep it tight. J.J. McCarthy’s 16.72 helped JamesHanlin scrape over the line, proving that a dominant RB day can nearly singlehandedly win a matchup – but balanced support remains key.

### RedCordial (6-4) 112.98 – 129.2 NickDagan (9-1)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Jahmyr Gibbs (DET RB – 38.2 pts), 🎯 Emeka Egbuka (TB WR – 23.5 pts)
NickDagan’s top-ranked squad couldn’t quite hold off RedCordial’s determined challenge. Jahmyr Gibbs delivered a massive 38.2 points, but Emeka Egbuka’s breakout 23.5 points and Christian McCaffrey’s solid 17.6 powered RedCordial to a solid 112.98 total. Seattle’s defense chipped in 23 points for NickDagan, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the offensive onslaught. RedCordial’s win tightens the chase at the top, proving even the best aren’t invincible.

### Wastingtime02 (4-6) 80.8 – 135.64 Mheineger (4-6)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Jameson Williams (DET WR – 23.9 pts), 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 20.3 pts)
Mheineger’s explosive 135.64 points were powered by Jameson Williams’ 23.9 and Josh Allen’s 20.34, but it was Wastingtime02’s gritty 80.8 that ultimately stole the win. Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s 20.3 points and Daniel Jones’ steady 16.5 proved just enough to pull off a surprising upset. This result shows that sometimes, even a big score isn’t a guaranteed win if the other side nails the right matchups.

### TheMianimal (3-7) 132.1 – 111.24 leftovername (4-6)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Caleb Williams (CHI QB – 25.1 pts), 🏃 Kyren Williams (LAR RB – 22.4 pts)
TheMianimal shocked the league with a big 132.1 points to beat leftovername, thanks to Caleb Williams’ 25.1 points and Kyren Williams’ 22.4. Despite Breece Hall’s solid 19.5 and Lamar Jackson’s 16.64, leftovername couldn’t keep pace. This upset win lifts TheMianimal from the depths and shows how one strong QB and RB combo can turn the tide, especially when the opposition’s stars come up just short.

**Power Pulse**
- 🏆 Star RBs lit up scoreboards but balanced teams still rule the day.
- • Close finishes and surprising upsets keep the playoff race bubbling.
- • Watch for late-season surges from underdogs like TheMianimal and jacross2000.
