### naveb (8-4) 90.6 – 111.22 Wastingtime02 (5-7)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 George Pickens (DAL WR – 29.6 pts), 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 37.1 pts)
Despite George Pickens lighting up the scoreboard with 29.6 points, naveb couldn't contain Wastingtime02’s Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who torched defenses for a massive 37.1 points. Derrick Henry also chipped in 22.8 points, giving Wastingtime02 the edge in this shootout. Chase Brown’s 15 points for naveb were solid but not enough to keep pace. Wastingtime02’s balanced attack and big plays downfield were the difference, pulling off a crucial win to improve their record.

### jacross2000 (2-10) 96.84 – 80.76 TheMianimal (3-9)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Amon-Ra St. Brown (DET WR – 29.9 pts), 🧠 Caleb Williams (CHI QB – 21.66 pts)
Jacross2000 finally found some fantasy mojo, led by Amon-Ra St. Brown’s impressive 29.9 points and Hunter Henry’s 24.5. Caleb Williams had a decent outing with 21.66 points, but TheMianimal’s offense couldn’t keep up, and their kicker Jason Myers added 13 points which wasn’t enough to close the gap. This low-scoring affair saw jacross2000 edge out TheMianimal, snapping their losing skid in style.

### mavbenson (7-5) 148.08 – 117.36 RedCordial (6-6)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Davante Adams (LAR WR – 23.2 pts), 🧠 Dak Prescott (DAL QB – 28.06 pts)
Mavbenson’s lineup exploded for 148.08 points, powered by Davante Adams’ reliable 23.2 points and Jacoby Brissett’s steady 18.68. RedCordial’s Dak Prescott threw up a strong 28.06 and Christian McCaffrey churned out 27.2 points, but it wasn’t enough to keep pace with mavbenson’s offensive firepower. The balance and depth of mavbenson’s team proved decisive in this high-scoring clash.

### Dell2620 (8-4) 102.76 – 52.72 Mheineger (4-8)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Jalen Hurts (PHI QB – 30.86 pts), 🎯 Cam Little (JAX K – 13.0 pts)
Dell2620 cruised to an easy victory behind Jalen Hurts’ dynamic 30.86 points and a stout Cleveland defense contributing 18 points. Mheineger struggled to get going, with Cam Little’s 13 points the only bright spot. Baltimore’s defense could only muster 12 points, failing to slow down Hurts and company. Dell2620’s balanced attack and defensive dominance sealed this one comfortably.

### NickDagan (11-1) 151.96 – 132.02 JamesHanlin (7-5)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Jahmyr Gibbs (DET RB – 55.4 pts), 🎯 Wan'Dale Robinson (NYG WR – 30.6 pts)
NickDagan’s Jahmyr Gibbs was an absolute beast, piling up a jaw-dropping 55.4 points to lead his team to a huge 151.96 total. Michael Wilson’s 21.8 points added extra firepower. JamesHanlin fought back hard with Wan'Dale Robinson’s 30.6 and Travis Etienne’s 20.6, but it was a classic case of too little, too late. The sheer volume from Gibbs was the deciding factor in this high-scoring thriller.

### leftovername (5-7) 80.62 – 124.36 warkha (6-6)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Breece Hall (NYJ RB – 13.9 pts), 🎯 A.J. Brown (PHI WR – 25.0 pts)
In a surprising upset, leftovername edged out warkha despite the latter’s strong showings from A.J. Brown (25.0 points) and Rashee Rice (24.1). Breece Hall and Jaylen Warren provided steady, if unspectacular, production that proved just enough. Warkha’s solid WR duo wasn’t matched by enough supporting cast points, handing leftovername a welcome win to keep their playoff hopes flickering.

**Power Pulse**
- 🏆 Jahmyr Gibbs’ 55.4 points might be the fantasy play of the week, single-handedly carrying NickDagan.
- • Despite Pickens’ big numbers, Wastingtime02’s Smith-Njigba was the real game-changer in their upset over naveb.
