- Despite Trey McBride’s monster 37.4 points, warkha couldn’t overcome Wastingtime02’s Brock Purdy and Courtland Sutton combo.

### naveb (9-5) 66.9 – 76.56 RedCordial (8-6)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Bijan Robinson (ATL RB – 29.5 pts), 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 15.7 pts)
naveb leaned heavily on Bijan Robinson’s huge 29.5-point effort, but it wasn’t quite enough to topple RedCordial. Christian McCaffrey chipped in a solid 15.7 points, with Dak Prescott adding nearly 12 points to round out a balanced attack. Despite Chase Brown’s decent 16 points for naveb, RedCordial’s steady production across key positions edged out a close 76.56 to 66.9 victory. Robinson’s big day was a highlight, but RedCordial’s depth proved the difference in a tight contest.

### mavbenson (8-6) 135.38 – 76.7 Dell2620 (8-6)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 TreVeyon Henderson (NE RB – 30.1 pts), 🧠 Bo Nix (DEN QB – 29.08 pts)
mavbenson absolutely dominated with a fantasy clinic from TreVeyon Henderson and Bo Nix, who combined for nearly 60 points. Henderson’s 30.1 points powered the ground game, while Nix lit up the scoreboard with 29.08 points at QB. Dell2620 had a solid showing from Jalen Hurts and CeeDee Lamb, but their efforts paled in comparison to mavbenson’s firepower. This blowout victory at 135.38 to 76.7 showcased how explosive performances can tilt the scales decisively in fantasy football.

### Wastingtime02 (5-9) 112.4 – 159.82 warkha (7-7)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Brock Purdy (SF QB – 26.2 pts), 🧲 Trey McBride (ARI TE – 37.4 pts)
warkha put up a monster 159.82 points led by Trey McBride’s jaw-dropping 37.4 at tight end and Jared Goff’s strong 25.52 points. However, Wastingtime02’s Brock Purdy and Courtland Sutton combined for over 50 points, enough to squeak out a 112.4 to 159.82 win in a high-scoring affair. McBride’s huge day was a standout, but the rest of warkha’s squad couldn’t quite keep pace with the balanced attack from Wastingtime02, proving fantasy is a team game after all.

### leftovername (5-9) 83.1 – 133.52 Mheineger (6-8)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Troy Franklin (DEN WR – 20.8 pts), 🎯 Jameson Williams (DET WR – 26.4 pts)
leftovername pulled a surprising upset over Mheineger despite being the underdog. Troy Franklin’s 20.8 points and Lamar Jackson’s steady 15.6 at QB gave leftovername enough juice to outscore a strong Mheineger squad. Jameson Williams and Josh Allen put up solid numbers for Mheineger, but they couldn’t close the gap as leftovername’s balanced attack held firm. This matchup was a reminder that fantasy football often hinges on timely contributions from unexpected places.

**Power Pulse**
- 🏆 Big individual weeks from RBs Henderson and Robinson highlight the power of explosive ground games.
- • Quarterbacks Bo Nix and Brock Purdy showed how a strong QB day can swing matchups hard.
- • Despite monster numbers from Trey McBride and Jameson Williams, fantasy football remains a full-team effort.
