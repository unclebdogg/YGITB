### jacross2000 (3-11) 71.8 – 100.1 TheMianimal (4-10)
**Star Performers:** 🛡️ Minnesota (MIN DEF – 23.0 pts), 🎯 Chris Godwin (TB WR – 23.8 pts)
TheMianimal’s Chris Godwin and Caleb Williams lit up the scoreboard with 23.8 and 23 points respectively, looking set to cruise to victory. However, jacross2000 leaned heavily on the Minnesota defense, which racked up a hefty 23 points, and Amon-Ra St. Brown’s reliable 14.8 points to keep the scoreboard ticking. Despite TheMianimal’s 100.1 points, jacross2000’s 71.8 was enough to squeak out the upset win thanks to key defensive plays and St. Brown’s steady presence. A solid defensive showing proved the difference in this close contest.

### mavbenson (8-6) 78.58 – 107.18 RedCordial (8-6)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Jacoby Brissett (ARI QB – 16.48 pts), 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 28.1 pts)
RedCordial’s dynamic duo of Christian McCaffrey and Dak Prescott put up huge numbers, with CMC’s 28.1 points stealing the show. Despite this, mavbenson’s Jacoby Brissett and Puka Nacua kept the game competitive. Unfortunately for mavbenson, they couldn’t match the firepower of RedCordial’s stars. McCaffrey’s explosive runs and Dak’s steady arm proved crucial, pushing RedCordial past the 100-point mark and securing a convincing win over a tough mavbenson squad.

### Wastingtime02 (5-9) 134.72 – 89.5 leftovername (5-9)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Derrick Henry (BAL RB – 45.6 pts), 🧠 Brock Purdy (SF QB – 37.92 pts)
Wastingtime02 unleashed a fantasy juggernaut as Derrick Henry bulldozed defenses for a monstrous 45.6 points, with Brock Purdy adding a hefty 37.92 points through the air. This combo proved unstoppable, powering Wastingtime02 to a massive 134.72 total. Leftovername’s Stefon Diggs and Breece Hall put together solid efforts but were left chasing shadows. The sheer dominance of Henry’s ground game and Purdy’s efficient passing made this a blowout, leaving leftovername struggling to keep pace.

### NickDagan (12-2) 114.04 – 129.4 JamesHanlin (9-5)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Chris Olave (NO WR – 25.9 pts), 🎯 Ja'Marr Chase (CIN WR – 25.0 pts)
In a high-scoring thriller, NickDagan’s Chris Olave and Michael Wilson racked up big points but were ultimately outgunned by JamesHanlin’s Ja'Marr Chase and Wan'Dale Robinson. Chase’s 25 points and Robinson’s 22.3 were just enough to tip the scales in JamesHanlin’s favour, who posted a strong 129.4 total against the league-leading NickDagan. Despite the loss, NickDagan’s squad showed plenty of firepower, but JamesHanlin’s balance and clutch plays made the difference in this nail-biter.
