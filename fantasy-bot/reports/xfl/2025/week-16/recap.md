### naveb (9-5) 146.5 – 82.5 Dell2620 (8-6)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Chase Brown (CIN RB – 32.9 pts), 🏃 Bijan Robinson (ATL RB – 29.8 pts)
Naveb blew the doors off Dell2620 with a ruthless RB combo. Chase Brown ripped through Cincinnati’s defence for 32.9 points, while Bijan Robinson added a hefty 29.8 from Atlanta’s backfield. Dell2620’s Jalen Hurts and Juwan Johnson put up respectable numbers but never threatened to close the gap. The double-RB explosion gave Naveb a commanding 64-point margin, a statement win that cements their strong playoff push.

### jacross2000 (3-11) 66.48 – 116.34 leftovername (5-9)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Jaylen Warren (PIT RB – 29.1 pts), 🎯 Stefon Diggs (NE WR – 22.8 pts)
Leftovername’s Jaylen Warren and Stefon Diggs delivered the goods, piling up over 50 points to outgun jacross2000. Despite James Cook’s strong 26.4 points and Minnesota’s stout defence, jacross2000 couldn’t stem the tide. The big plays from Warren and Diggs carried leftovername to a decisive victory, snapping a tough losing streak.

### mavbenson (8-6) 128.88 – 153.6 NickDagan (12-2)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Puka Nacua (LAR WR – 46.5 pts), 🎯 Chris Olave (NO WR – 36.8 pts)
In a high-scoring showdown, mavbenson’s Puka Nacua exploded for a jaw-dropping 46.5 points, nearly toppling the league-leading NickDagan. Despite Kenneth Gainwell’s solid 23.8 points, mavbenson fell short as NickDagan’s Chris Olave and Justin Herbert combined for over 66 points. It was a thrilling duel of top WR talent with NickDagan holding on to preserve their top spot.

### RedCordial (8-6) 132.06 – 138.26 JamesHanlin (9-5)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 32.6 pts), 🧠 Joe Burrow (CIN QB – 28.96 pts)
This nail-biter saw JamesHanlin squeak past RedCordial despite a double-RB assault from McCaffrey and Jeanty. Christian McCaffrey churned out 32.6 points, with Ashton Jeanty adding 31.8, but Joe Burrow’s clutch 28.96 and George Kittle’s 24.5 proved just enough to edge out the win. A tight finish that leaves both teams eyeing playoff positioning closely.

### Wastingtime02 (5-9) 136.1 – 100.1 TheMianimal (4-10)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Brock Purdy (SF QB – 31.9 pts), 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 23.6 pts)
Wastingtime02’s Brock Purdy and Jaxon Smith-Njigba lit up the scoreboard, combining for over 55 points to power past TheMianimal. Despite Saquon Barkley’s decent 21.2 points and Caleb Williams’ 21.0, TheMianimal couldn’t match the offensive firepower. A solid win that could spark a late-season rally for Wastingtime02.

### warkha (7-7) 116.66 – 59.7 Mheineger (6-8)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Jared Goff (DET QB – 26.46 pts), 🏃 RJ Harvey (DEN RB – 22.1 pts)
Warkha cruised to a commanding win as Jared Goff and RJ Harvey combined for nearly 50 points. Mheineger’s stars Jameson Williams and Houston defence failed to ignite, delivering underwhelming outputs. The dominant performance gives warkha a boost as the season winds down.
