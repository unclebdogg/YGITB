- Christian McCaffrey’s 39.1-point explosion carried RedCordial to a gritty win despite leftovername’s hustle.
- Jahmyr Gibbs and Justin Herbert put on a show for NickDagan, but Dell2620’s balanced attack pulled off a stunning upset.
- Jaxson Dart’s breakout 29.42 points and Tee Higgins’ 21.6 points powered naveb past jacross2000 with authority.

### naveb (5-2) 137.42 – 87.72 jacross2000 (1-6)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Jaxson Dart (NYG QB – 29.42 pts), 🎯 Tee Higgins (CIN WR – 21.6 pts)
naveb flexed serious firepower this week, led by Jaxson Dart’s breakout 29.42 points and Tee Higgins’ reliable 21.6. Dart’s sharp passing carved up jacross2000’s defence, setting the tone early. Although Amon-Ra St. Brown racked up a tidy 20.6 for jacross2000, Baker Mayfield’s modest 12.12 points couldn’t keep pace. The 49.7-point gap was a clear demonstration of naveb’s offensive balance and depth, leaving jacross2000 struggling to respond.

### mavbenson (5-2) 152.16 – 132.48 warkha (2-5)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Bo Nix (DEN QB – 39.96 pts), 🎯 Davante Adams (LAR WR – 26.5 pts)
Bo Nix was an absolute weapon for mavbenson, nearly hitting 40 points and keeping the scoreboard lighting up. Davante Adams added a hefty 26.5 points, creating a dynamic duo that overwhelmed warkha’s defence. Despite Trey McBride’s stellar 29.4 and A.J. Brown’s 28.1 points pushing warkha’s lineup to a competitive 132.48, mavbenson’s offensive juggernaut proved just too strong in this shootout. A classic shootout where QBs and WRs stole the show.

### RedCordial (5-2) 101.96 – 92.1 leftovername (2-5)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 39.1 pts), 🎯 Keenan Allen (LAC WR – 28.9 pts)
RedCordial leaned heavily on Christian McCaffrey’s monster 39.1 points and Keenan Allen’s consistent 28.9 to grind out a win over leftovername. Jaylen Warren’s 19.8 and Detroit’s defence scoring 14 points kept leftovername in the hunt, but they couldn’t quite match CMC’s all-around dominance or Allen’s reliable hands. The final score was tighter than expected, but RedCordial’s elite RB-WR combo made the difference.

### Dell2620 (5-2) 135.94 – 168.0 NickDagan (6-1)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Jalen Hurts (PHI QB – 24.04 pts), 🎯 CeeDee Lamb (DAL WR – 22.0 pts)
NickDagan’s high-powered squad led by Jahmyr Gibbs (36.8) and Justin Herbert (29.9) appeared ready to dominate, but Dell2620’s balanced output with Jalen Hurts and CeeDee Lamb kept the contest competitive. Despite the star power on both sides, NickDagan’s 168 points were a massive effort, though it wasn’t enough to topple Dell2620’s sturdy lineup. This clash was a fantasy feast with no shortage of highlight-reel plays.

### Wastingtime02 (4-3) 95.32 – 94.22 TheMianimal (2-5)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 26.3 pts), 🧠 Daniel Jones (IND QB – 22.22 pts)
A nail-biter to the end with Wastingtime02 edging TheMianimal by just over a single point. Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s 26.3 points and Daniel Jones’ steady 22.22 helped secure the win, outduelling TheMianimal’s Travis Hunter (24.1) and Ladd McConkey (15.7). This one came down to clutch plays and timing, with Wastingtime02 just managing to hold on in a thriller.

- 🏆 Bo Nix’s fantasy explosion keeps mavbenson cruising near the top of the table.
