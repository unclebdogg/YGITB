### naveb (3-1) 144.34 – 136.18 JamesHanlin (1-3)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 George Pickens (DAL WR – 33.4 pts), 🏃 Bijan Robinson (ATL RB – 28.1 pts)
Naveb's tight 8-point win over JamesHanlin was powered by George Pickens' electrifying 33.4 points, showcasing his big-play ability. Bijan Robinson added a strong 28.1 points, balancing the attack. JamesHanlin fought hard with Jordan Love (26.28) and Quentin Johnston (23.8), but the combined firepower of Pickens and Bijan proved just enough to hold off the challenge in this nail-biter.

### jacross2000 (1-3) 132.86 – 126.26 RedCordial (3-1)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Dak Prescott (DAL QB – 30.96 pts), 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 26.1 pts)
In a bit of a surprise, jacross2000 fell short despite strong performances from Amon-Ra St. Brown (26.0) and James Cook (22.5). RedCordial's dynamic duo of Dak Prescott (30.96) and Christian McCaffrey (26.1) put up monster numbers, but it wasn’t quite enough to hold off the determined jacross2000, who eked out the win thanks to balanced scoring across the board.

### mavbenson (2-2) 160.44 – 77.88 TheMianimal (2-2)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Puka Nacua (LAR WR – 36.0 pts), 🧠 Bo Nix (DEN QB – 26.74 pts)
Mavbenson trounced TheMianimal in a blowout, thanks to Puka Nacua's jaw-dropping 36 points and Bo Nix's strong 26.74 from the QB spot. TheMianimal's Kyle Pitts and Saquon Barkley put in decent efforts but were overwhelmed by mavbenson's offensive fireworks, turning this matchup into a one-sided affair.

### Dell2620 (4-0) 132.2 – 114.28 leftovername (1-3)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Bucky Irving (TB RB – 25.5 pts), 🧠 Jalen Hurts (PHI QB – 19.4 pts)
Dell2620 remains unbeaten with a solid 18-point win over leftovername. Bucky Irving's 25.5 points led the charge, complemented by steady production from Jalen Hurts. Although leftovername had a strong showing from Justin Jefferson (22.6) and Detroit’s defense (20.0), it wasn’t enough to topple the league leaders this week.

### warkha (1-3) 96.92 – 123.06 Mheineger (1-3)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Josh Jacobs (GB RB – 31.7 pts), 🧠 Josh Allen (BUF QB – 25.86 pts)
Despite Josh Jacobs' monster 31.7 points and Josh Allen's 25.86, Mheineger couldn’t convert those star performances into a win, falling to warkha. Warkha’s balanced attack including Khalil Shakir and De'Von Achane helped tip the scales in a competitive matchup, showing that even big individual scores don’t guarantee victory.
