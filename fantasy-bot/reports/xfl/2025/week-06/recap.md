### naveb (4-2) 128.1 – 96.8 TheMianimal (2-4)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Bijan Robinson (ATL RB – 35.8 pts), 🎯 George Pickens (DAL WR – 31.8 pts)
Naveb’s big guns Bijan Robinson and George Pickens delivered a one-two punch that TheMianimal just couldn’t handle. Bijan ran roughshod for 35.8 points, powering through ATL’s backfield like a freight train, while Pickens caught fire with 31.8 points, lighting up the scoreboard. TheMianimal’s Ladd McConkey and Sam Darnold put up respectable numbers but fell short against the sheer firepower. This dominant performance lifts naveb to 4-2, asserting their playoff push with authority.

### jacross2000 (1-5) 102.58 – 93.74 Wastingtime02 (3-3)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 30.2 pts), 🧠 Daniel Jones (IND QB – 23.48 pts)
In a surprising twist, jacross2000 edged out Wastingtime02 despite the latter’s stars shining bright. Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s 30.2 points and Daniel Jones’ 23.48 kept Wastingtime02 in striking distance, but jacross2000’s Brian Thomas and Baker Mayfield combined for steady production that just nudged them over the line. This close tussle shows jacross2000 fighting hard to escape the cellar, while Wastingtime02’s season hangs in the balance.

### mavbenson (4-2) 107.36 – 56.0 leftovername (2-4)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Drake London (ATL WR – 31.8 pts), 🧲 Tyler Warren (IND TE – 18.3 pts)
Mavbenson’s offense was firing on all cylinders as Drake London’s 31.8 points and Tyler Warren’s 18.3 put leftovername to the sword. Despite Travis Kelce’s usual magic being somewhat muted at 13.8 points, leftovername couldn’t find an answer to the balanced assault. This blowout win boosts mavbenson’s record and confidence, while leftovername faces a steep climb back into contention.

### RedCordial (4-2) 93.64 – 118.94 warkha (2-4)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 24.1 pts), 🧠 Dak Prescott (DAL QB – 22.34 pts)
Warkha’s De'Von Achane exploded for 31 points and Drake Maye nearly matched that with 27.24, but RedCordial’s combo of Christian McCaffrey and Dak Prescott proved just enough to scrape out a win. McCaffrey’s 24.1 and Prescott’s 22.34 kept the scoreboard ticking and sealed a gritty victory. Warkha’s high-powered attack showed promise but fell just short in this nail-biter.

### Dell2620 (5-1) 101.24 – 161.84 JamesHanlin (2-4)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Cam Skattebo (NYG RB – 31.0 pts), 🧠 Jalen Hurts (PHI QB – 21.62 pts)
Despite JamesHanlin lighting up the scoreboard with a monster 161.84 points led by Rico Dowdle’s 33.9 and Ja'Marr Chase’s 25.1, Dell2620’s steady production from Cam Skattebo and Jalen Hurts was enough to claim the win. Skattebo bulldozed for 31 points while Hurts orchestrated the offense with 21.62 points. This close outcome highlights how even an explosive week can sometimes fall short against consistent scoring depth.

### NickDagan (5-1) 97.76 – 143.1 Mheineger (2-4)
**Star Performers:** 🛡️ Los Angeles (LAR DEF – 19.0 pts), 🧠 Justin Herbert (LAC QB – 18.76 pts)
Mheineger’s Josh Jacobs and D'Andre Swift combined for a huge 57.5 points to power a convincing 143.1 total, but NickDagan’s Los Angeles defense and Justin Herbert kept them competitive. The LAR DEF’s 19 points and Herbert’s 18.76 showed resilience but couldn’t stem the tide. Mheineger’s dominant ground game and overall output make this a tough loss for NickDagan, who now stands at 5-1 but will need more firepower to close out the season strong.
