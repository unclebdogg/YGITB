### naveb (8-3) 138.34 – 105.68 Mheineger (4-7)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Bijan Robinson (ATL RB – 30.3 pts), 🎯 George Pickens (DAL WR – 29.4 pts)
Naveb flexed serious muscle this week, with Bijan Robinson charging through defenses for a massive 30.3 points and George Pickens adding a slick 29.4. Mheineger had Josh Allen lighting it up with 44.68 points, a near Herculean effort, but it wasn’t quite enough to topple Naveb’s balanced assault. Jameson Williams chipped in solidly with 19.7 points, but the gap created by Robinson and Pickens was just too wide. A statement win for Naveb, keeping their playoff hopes alive and well.

### jacross2000 (1-10) 88.62 – 124.52 leftovername (5-6)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Deebo Samuel (WAS WR – 20.7 pts), 🏃 James Cook (BUF RB – 20.4 pts)
In a surprising upset, jacross2000 edged out leftovername despite the latter’s big guns. Tetairoa McMillan dazzled with 33 points and Travis Kelce brought in 24.1, but it wasn’t enough to quell the firepower from Deebo Samuel and James Cook, who combined for over 41 points. Kelce’s quiet week relative to his usual dominance might have been the difference, as jacross2000 clawed back to snag a win in what was expected to be a tough slog.

### mavbenson (6-5) 107.5 – 117.74 NickDagan (10-1)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 TreVeyon Henderson (NE RB – 32.3 pts), 🎯 Puka Nacua (LAR WR – 14.3 pts)
NickDagan’s dominance this season almost took a hit as mavbenson brought the heat. TreVeyon Henderson’s 32.3 points kept mavbenson in striking distance, with Puka Nacua providing steady support. But Michael Wilson’s 33.5 points and Kenneth Walker’s 20.1 for NickDagan proved just enough to hold on. A tight contest that nearly saw the top dog toppled, but NickDagan keeps their unbeaten march mostly intact.

### RedCordial (6-5) 92.9 – 109.86 JamesHanlin (7-4)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 35.1 pts), 🎯 Tyler Loop (BAL K – 12.0 pts)
RedCordial leaned heavily on Christian McCaffrey’s monster 35.1 points to keep pace with JamesHanlin, who leaned on George Kittle’s 24.7 and Travis Etienne’s 19.3. Tyler Loop’s 12 points from the boot also added crucial margin. Despite the efforts, JamesHanlin’s balanced attack just outpaced RedCordial’s singular star power, making for a solid win but a reminder that McCaffrey alone can only carry so far.

### Dell2620 (7-4) 137.0 – 127.5 Wastingtime02 (4-7)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Sean Tucker (TB RB – 34.0 pts), 🏃 Devin Singletary (NYG RB – 17.7 pts)
Dell2620’s Sean Tucker bulldozed to 34 points, with Devin Singletary’s steady 17.7 adding fuel to the fire. Wastingtime02 fought back hard, led by the Pittsburgh defense’s 22 points and Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s 20.6, but it wasn’t enough. Dell2620’s double RB threat proved just a bit too much in this high-scoring thriller, keeping their record strong and playoff hopes glowing.

### TheMianimal (3-8) 68.12 – 136.34 warkha (5-6)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Kyren Williams (LAR RB – 16.6 pts), 🎯 Jason Myers (SEA K – 14.0 pts)
