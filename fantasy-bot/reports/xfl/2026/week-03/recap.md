### naveb (9-5) 95.4 – 102.64 RedCordial (8-6)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 24.0 pts), 🎯 Ricky Pearsall (SF WR – 19.7 pts)
In a tight tussle, RedCordial edged out naveb by a slim margin. Christian McCaffrey was the standout, pounding out 24 fantasy points with his usual finesse. J.K. Dobbins chipped in solidly, but it was McCaffrey's dominance that made the difference. Naveb's Ricky Pearsall and George Pickens put up respectable numbers but just couldn’t match the sheer ground game force of RedCordial. Despite the effort, naveb fell just short in this nail-biter.

### jacross2000 (3-11) 109.22 – 112.84 Dell2620 (8-6)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Jalen Hurts (PHI QB – 29.04 pts), 🏃 Jordan Mason (MIN RB – 23.6 pts)
Dell2620 narrowly escaped with a victory in a high-scoring thriller. Jalen Hurts was a fantasy dynamo, carving up defenses for 29 points, while Michael Pittman also made waves. Jacross2000's duo of Jordan Mason and James Cook put up a fierce fight, combining for over 44 points, but it wasn’t quite enough to topple the efficient Dell2620 squad. A heartbreaker for jacross2000, showing grit despite the odds.

### mavbenson (8-6) 97.52 – 111.42 Wastingtime02 (5-9)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA WR – 20.6 pts), 🎯 Puka Nacua (LAR WR – 22.8 pts)
Wastingtime02 took this one by storm, riding the wave of Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s slick 20.6 points and kicker Chase McLaughlin’s surprising 20-point boot. Mavbenson’s Puka Nacua dazzled with nearly 23 points, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Wastingtime02’s balanced attack. The game was a showcase of WR talent, with both sides lighting it up but Wastingtime02 holding the edge in consistency and clutch scoring.

### NickDagan (12-2) 136.0 – 89.42 leftovername (5-9)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Jahmyr Gibbs (DET RB – 26.9 pts), 🧠 Lamar Jackson (BAL QB – 27.02 pts)
NickDagan put on a fantasy clinic, absolutely dominating leftovername with a massive 136-point haul. Jahmyr Gibbs powered through for nearly 27 points, and Garrett Wilson added a solid 24.4, creating a one-two punch too hot to handle. Even Lamar Jackson’s 27 points for leftovername couldn’t keep pace. Jefferson had a quiet day, and the deficit grew fast. NickDagan’s clinical precision crushed the contest and solidified their top spot.

### TheMianimal (4-10) 121.62 – 100.82 Mheineger (6-8)
**Star Performers:** 🛡️ Minnesota (MIN DEF – 35.0 pts), 🧠 Caleb Williams (CHI QB – 29.12 pts)
TheMianimal’s defense was the star of the show with a massive 35 points, shutting down Mheineger’s offense and swinging momentum. Caleb Williams, the rookie QB, dazzled with 29 points, stepping up big despite the team’s overall struggles. Mheineger’s Josh Allen and T.J. Hockenson fought hard but couldn’t crack the defensive wall. This one was all about TheMianimal’s grit and smart roster choices paying off when it mattered most.

### warkha (7-7) 115.52 – 109.32 JamesHanlin (9-5)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 A.J. Brown (PHI WR – 22.9 pts), 🏃 Jonathan Taylor (IND RB – 32.8 pts)
In a tight contest, warkha edged out JamesHanlin thanks to A.J. Brown and Nico Collins each putting up over 22 points. Despite Jonathan Taylor’s monster 32.8-point effort, JamesHanlin came up just short. Quentin Johnston’s quiet game hurt their chances, and warkha’s balanced WR attack proved decisive. A close call that could have swung either way, but warkha’s clutch performances sealed the deal.
