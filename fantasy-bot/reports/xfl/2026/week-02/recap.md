### naveb (9-5) 107.68 – 105.62 mavbenson (8-6)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Bijan Robinson (ATL RB – 19.8 pts), 🎯 George Pickens (DAL WR – 17.8 pts)
In a nail-biter, naveb squeaked past mavbenson by just over two points. Bijan Robinson’s consistent ground work and George Pickens’ reliable receiving helped keep the scoreboard ticking. Despite Puka Nacua lighting it up with 27.6 points and Tyreek Hill’s usual electric presence, mavbenson’s stars couldn’t quite close the gap. Naveb’s balanced attack just edged out the flashy fireworks, showing a classic battle of steady versus explosive.

### jacross2000 (3-11) 138.3 – 101.92 Mheineger (6-8)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Amon-Ra St. Brown (DET WR – 39.2 pts), 🏃 James Cook (BUF RB – 26.5 pts)
Jacross2000 shocked the league with a high-octane performance fueled by Amon-Ra St. Brown’s monster 39.2 points and James Cook’s solid 26.5. Mheineger tried to keep pace with a stout Baltimore defense and Nick Chubb’s 15.2 points but it wasn’t enough. This was a classic case of star power overwhelming a good but quieter effort. Jacross2000’s explosiveness put them back in the win column in style.

### RedCordial (8-6) 107.24 – 102.74 Wastingtime02 (5-9)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Rome Odunze (CHI WR – 31.8 pts), 🏃 Christian McCaffrey (SF RB – 22.7 pts)
RedCordial’s combo of Rome Odunze’s 31.8 points and Christian McCaffrey’s 22.7 proved just enough to fend off Wastingtime02’s Malik Nabers, who dazzled with 37.7 points, and Daniel Jones’ 22.84. The game was a seesaw battle with Wastingtime02’s stars shining bright but ultimately unable to overcome the balanced attack. RedCordial’s duo carried the day in a tight contest.

### Dell2620 (8-6) 115.94 – 98.28 TheMianimal (4-10)
**Star Performers:** 🧲 Tucker Kraft (GB TE – 24.4 pts), 🎯 CeeDee Lamb (DAL WR – 20.2 pts)
Dell2620’s strong day was anchored by Tucker Kraft’s surprising 24.4 points and CeeDee Lamb’s reliable 20.2. TheMianimal’s Caleb Williams and Saquon Barkley put up respectable numbers but couldn’t match the steady scoring. Kraft’s breakout performance as a tight end gave Dell2620 the edge in this one, showing the value of finding hidden gems.

### NickDagan (12-2) 114.78 – 105.6 warkha (7-7)
**Star Performers:** 🏃 Javonte Williams (DAL RB – 25.0 pts), 🏃 Jahmyr Gibbs (DET RB – 19.4 pts)
NickDagan’s ground game powered by Javonte Williams and Jahmyr Gibbs was too much for warkha despite the latter’s Drake Maye and De’Von Achane lighting up the scoreboard. Both Maye and Achane flirted with 26 points each, but NickDagan’s balanced rushing attack controlled the tempo and sealed the victory, maintaining their top-tier record.

### leftovername (5-9) 114.7 – 160.8 JamesHanlin (9-5)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Lamar Jackson (BAL QB – 26.3 pts), 🏃 Chuba Hubbard (CAR RB – 18.7 pts)
In an unexpected twist, leftovername upset JamesHanlin despite the latter’s massive points haul from Ja’Marr Chase (36.5) and Jonathan Taylor (29.5). Lamar Jackson’s dynamic 26.3 points and Chuba Hubbard’s steady 18.7 proved the difference as leftovername’s supporting cast stepped up. JamesHanlin’s stars shone bright but the depth wasn’t there to close out this nail-biter.
