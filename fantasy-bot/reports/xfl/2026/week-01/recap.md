### naveb (9-5) 128.42 – 114.98 Wastingtime02 (5-9)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Justin Fields (NYJ QB – 29.52 pts), 🏃 Bijan Robinson (ATL RB – 24.4 pts)
In a close scrap, naveb’s Justin Fields lit up the scoreboard with 29.52 points, orchestrating just enough magic to edge out Wastingtime02. Bijan Robinson’s powerful 24.4-point outing added the muscle, balancing the attack. Despite Derrick Henry’s near triple-digit effort at 29.2 points and Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s solid 19.4, Wastingtime02 came up short. The tight margin showed how Fields’ efficiency and Bijan’s ground game proved decisive in a fiery Week 1 clash.

### jacross2000 (3-11) 127.5 – 106.68 TheMianimal (4-10)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Caleb Williams (CHI QB – 24.2 pts), 🏃 Saquon Barkley (PHI RB – 18.4 pts)
Despite the loss, TheMianimal’s Caleb Williams and Saquon Barkley put up respectable numbers with 24.2 and 18.4 points, respectively. However, jacross2000’s Baker Mayfield and James Cook combined for a steady 43.78 points, pushing their side to a solid win. Cook’s 21.2 points helped control the ground game, while Mayfield’s 22.58 points kept drives alive. TheMianimal’s effort was valiant but fell short against jacross2000’s balanced attack.

### mavbenson (8-6) 120.74 – 120.32 RedCordial (8-6)
**Star Performers:** 🎯 Puka Nacua (LAR WR – 23.1 pts), 🏃 Dylan Sampson (CLE RB – 17.3 pts)
This one went down to the wire with mavbenson edging out RedCordial by less than half a point. Puka Nacua’s 23.1 points were a crucial spark, complemented by Dylan Sampson’s steady 17.3. On the other side, Emeka Egbuka and Christian McCaffrey combined for a towering 46.8 points, but it wasn’t quite enough. McCaffrey’s 23.2 points and Egbuka’s 23.6 were huge, yet mavbenson’s balanced scoring just nudged them past in a thriller.

### Dell2620 (8-6) 96.28 – 94.56 Mheineger (6-8)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Jalen Hurts (PHI QB – 24.28 pts), 🎯 CeeDee Lamb (DAL WR – 18 pts)
Mheineger’s Josh Allen was a beast with a massive 38.76 points, but Dell2620’s duo of Jalen Hurts and CeeDee Lamb combined for 42.28 points to sneak out the win. Hurts’ 24.28 points and Lamb’s reliable 18 kept Dell2620 just ahead despite Allen’s fireworks. Josh Jacobs’ quieter 14 points couldn’t bridge the gap, making this a nailbiter decided by balanced production over star power.

### NickDagan (12-2) 106.12 – 99.02 JamesHanlin (9-5)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Justin Herbert (LAC QB – 27.92 pts), 🎯 Garrett Wilson (NYJ WR – 22.5 pts)
NickDagan leaned heavily on Justin Herbert’s 27.92 points and Garrett Wilson’s 22.5 to secure a solid victory over JamesHanlin. JamesHanlin’s Jayden Daniels and Aaron Jones contributed well with 20.12 and 15.7 points, but it wasn’t enough to keep pace. Herbert’s consistent QB play and Wilson’s explosive WR performance were the difference-makers in this competitive Week 1 bout.

### leftovername (5-9) 123.76 – 78.58 warkha (7-7)
**Star Performers:** 🧠 Lamar Jackson (BAL QB – 29.36 pts), 🏃 Chuba Hubbard (CAR RB – 17.9 pts)
leftovername unleashed Lamar Jackson’s dynamic 29.36 points and Chuba Hubbard’s solid 17.9 to dominate warkha’s squad. Despite Drake Maye and De’Von Achane putting up decent 16.78 and 16.5 points, warkha was outgunned in all phases. Lamar’s electrifying playmaking and Hubbard’s steady ground gains powered leftovername’s commanding Week 1 win.
